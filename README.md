# Project Title: SchoolCool - Backend

SchoolCool is an all-in-one school management web application that aims to streamline administrative processes, improve communication, and enhance the overall educational experience for students, teachers, and parents. The application will be built using a modern technology stack to provide a user-friendly, efficient, and secure platform.

The front-end will be designed with a responsive and intuitive user interface, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices. The back-end will consist of a robust API that handles all data transactions and supports role-based access control to protect sensitive information. The database will store and manage all relevant data, including student records, staff information, course schedules, attendance, and grades.
